# nagios-api-go
## Simple nagios api

This is my golang learning project. However the first features already works which is read a service satatus.

TODO
- Implement authentication using jwt. Currently I ran use private network only controled by ec2 security group.
- Add all api call to read data (currently I only need service status for my work but better to implement them all)
- Maybe - add the execute nagios command (like downtime, etc..)
